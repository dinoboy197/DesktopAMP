# Accelerated Mobile Pages

The [AMP Project](https://www.ampproject.org) aims to improve the experience of
reading web content on mobile clients, while maintaining publisher's ability to
make money from their content (ads!).

For it to succeed, it needs to be adopted by clients. We built [Something](https://something.gd)
because we felt this very pain-point and are passionate about improving how people
read and discover content on mobile.

# AMP on the desktop

There's no reason to only consume AMP enabled content on mobile. For that reason
we've built Safari and Chrome extensions that will load AMP versions of articles
when present.

The AMP versions of articles, as well as loading faster, tend to be a lot
cleaner and easier to read. AMP supports ads, but not JavaScript, so any ads on
AMP articles should be a lot less obnoxious and resource intensive than is often
the case.

## Safari

[Safari Extension](https://github.com/edlea/DesktopAMP/raw/master/amp.safariextz) that will
redirect to the AMP version of pages when available.

## Chrome

[Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8F/igokgmnkplcfgnegidccbgmlnecaffhh) that will redirect to the AMP version of pages when available.

## Building

If you want to build from source, simply run

```
make
```

This will popluate the `Amp Chrome` and `Amp.safariextension` directories so you
can install the extensions locally.

# Trying it out

Over time, it's expected (hoped) that lots of publishers will support AMP. For now,
these publishers have quite a lot of their content available as AMP:

* [BBC News](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news)
* [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com)
* [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com)

Visit news articles from these publishers with either the Chrome or Safari extension
installed and enabled to view AMP versions.
